# Reading material for Unit 1:

## On basic math:
- If you need a reference for basic math, I suggest Arfken's book on Mathematical Methods for Physicists. This book has a compendium of the math you learned in earlier semesters.

## Further reading on QM:
- If you are looking for more information on quantum experiments and the phenomenology of QM, I recommend reading Chapters 4, 5, and 6 of Resnick and Halliday's book on Basic Concepts in Relativity and Early Quantum Theory. This book is a little old now, but has some nice descriptions on the QM experiments we discussed in class.

- I also recommend reading the Feynmann lectures in physics, the relevant part for Unit 1 can be found here:

## Experiments on wave-particle duality:

- "Buckyballs" show duality, see: https://www.nature.com/articles/44348
