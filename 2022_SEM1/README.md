# Quantum Mechanics I 

## Yachay Tech University - 2022

## About this repository:
This is a collection of lecture notes and programming exercises carried out as part of the Quantum Mechanics I course at Yachay Tech University from May to September 2022.

## Lecturer:
Wladimir Banda Barrag√°n

## Course description:
This course provides an introduction to the formal mathematical treatment of Quantum Mechanics. The course introduces the Schrodinger Equation and its solutions for different potentials, emphasising on its statistical interpretation and its importance for the description of experiments at quantum scales. Topics range from wave functions, the time-independent Schrodinger equation, through Hilbert spaces and the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, to the description of the hydrogen atom and two-particle systems. The course includes examples of different applications of quantum mechanics, including writing Hamiltonians for different physical systems and extracting information about them.
