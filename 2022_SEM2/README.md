# Quantum Mechanics I 

## Yachay Tech University - 2022/2023

## About this repository:
This is a collection of lecture notes and programming exercises carried out as part of the Quantum Mechanics I course at Yachay Tech University from November 2022 to March 2023.

## Lecturer:
Wladimir Banda Barragán

## Course description:
This course provides an introduction to the formal mathematical treatment of Quantum Mechanics. The course introduces the Schrodinger Equation and its solutions for different potentials, emphasising on its statistical interpretation and its importance for the description of experiments at quantum scales. Topics range from wave functions, the time-independent Schrodinger equation, through Hilbert spaces and the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, to the description of the hydrogen atom and two-particle systems. The course includes examples of different applications of quantum mechanics, including writing Hamiltonians for different physical systems and extracting information about them.

## Course objectives:
- Understand the fundamental ideas and experiments that led to the formulation of quantum mechanics.

- Learn the mathematical skills and formalism needed to solve Schrödinger’s equation and interpret its solutions.

- Study the Hamiltonians of quantum systems in 1D and 3D for different potentials and coordinates, and provide a detailed quantum description of the hydrogen atom.

- Use quantum mechanics to analyse real microscopic phenomena and interpret experimental data.
